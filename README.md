# ENTS Node Enclosure

If you are looking to get started right away here is the instruction manual! [Instruction Manual]()

### Project Summary

Before beginning the MAE 156 project, researchers using the ENTS generally used an IP68 rated Polycase enclosure to house the node during outdoor deployments. This was an undesirable solution because it was not cost effective at about $49 USD to house a single node and because it required researchers to modify the enclosure to suit their needs regarding cable connections. This was what led the projectâ€™s sponsor, Steve Taylor, to form the ENTS team in order to produce a new enclosure with the goal of it also being open-source. There is a need for an enclosure for the ENTS node that follows the following functional requirements: 
   - Low cost (< $40)
   - Accessible to environmental researchers across the country
   - Waterproof
   - Is non-toxic to the environment in which it is deployed in 
   - Does not interfere with data transmission
   - Can allow for variable number of cable connections
   
The goal of the enclosure for the ENTS node is to improve the node's performance for researchers during deployments. Having an enclosure made specifically for their purposes would mean that they would not have to spend resources on tailoring it to their preferences and environments. Having a secure enclosure also prevents leakage, ensuring that the node does not get damaged during deployment. To address these requirements, this project developed two designs: a 3D-printed enclosure using PLA material with a watertight sealant coating, and a PVC enclosure using off-the-shelf components. Both design solutions meet all functional requirements and have their own unique pros and cons. Researchers creating these enclosures pick which design to use based on their specific deployment needs and the tools available to their disposal. 

Here are our two unique enclosure designs (CAD Files are provided as STL & Fusion Files in the repository):

After testing in the Kendall Frost Marsh Reserve, both enclosures demonstrated excellent waterproofing capabilities, lasting a week submerged without water ingress or significant humidity increase. See "Project Links" section below for a detailed enclosure instruction manual, project report and website.
